# put any custom code you want to be executed in the
# following block. This code will be automatically executed
# after the GUI has been set up but before the diff is 
# performed. Use this code to customize the interface if
# you so desire.
#  
# Even though you can't (as of version 3.09) edit this 
# code via the preferences dialog, it will be automatically
# saved and restored if you do a SAVE from that dialog.

# Unless you really know what you are doing, it is probably
# wise to leave this unmodified.
